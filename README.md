<Dear, viewer, Iâ€™m here to showcase my 3D Assets and Textures collection, this is an archive of all the different creations that in all the year Iâ€™ve achieved, I divided all the selection by years and years of progress, Iâ€™ve started this journey of creating 3D asset back into 2020, during the pandemic Iâ€™ve started my own small business of creating mods for a game called Grand Theft Auto V, by modding this game Iâ€™ve learnt more than what maybe you can think, Iâ€™ve studied how game engines works, how the texture works, how to create functional 3d asset with a realistic look, with this experience other than learning how the things works, Iâ€™ve started using 3DS Max and Substance Painter, now Iâ€™m trying to creating AAA asset from small props to houses or bridges, with handmade/smart materials textures and AAA quality topology of meshes.>

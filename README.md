```<Dear, viewer, i'll talk about my self, iâ€™ve started this journey of creating 3D asset back into 2020, during the pandemic Iâ€™ve started my own small business of creating mods for a game called Grand Theft Auto V, by modding this game Iâ€™ve learnt more than what maybe you can think, Iâ€™ve studied how game engines works, how the texture works, how to create functional 3d asset with a realistic look, with this experience other than learning how the things works, Iâ€™ve started using 3DS Max, Blender, and Substance Painter, now Iâ€™m trying to creating AAA asset from small props to houses or bridges, with handmade/smart materials textures and AAA quality topology of meshes.>```
